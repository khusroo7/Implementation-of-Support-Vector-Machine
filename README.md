# Implementation-of-Support-Vector-Machine
Libraries Import:
<br>
The notebook starts by importing essential libraries, including NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn (sklearn), and Matplotlib.
<br>
Dataset Loading:
<br>
The Iris dataset is loaded into the notebook using the load_iris() function from scikit-learn and is stored in a DataFrame for further analysis.
<br>
Accuracy: Measures the proportion of correctly predicted instances out of the total number of instances.
<br>
Confusion Matrix: Provides a detailed breakdown of the model's performance by showing the counts of true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative predictions.
<br>
Model Preparation:
<br>
The dataset is divided into training and testing sets using the train_test_split function.
